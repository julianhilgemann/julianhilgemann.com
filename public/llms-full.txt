## Experience

Selected Experience & Systems
                    Built

                    With 3+ years of experience building and operating
                    production analytics systems in high-stakes fintech environments,
                    my core focus is owning the Power BI decision layer — the point where data becomes trusted, repeatable business
                    action.

                    I’ve owned and operated production Power BI environments
                    spanning 10+ dashboards used daily by executive leadership,
                    sales, and operations. This included end-to-end
                    responsibility for semantic modeling, KPI logic, access
                    control, performance optimization, and long-term
                    maintainability — treating BI as a product, not a reporting
                    artifact.

                    Underneath the dashboard layer, I’ve worked extensively on
                    analytics engineering and data modeling: designing metric
                    layers, contributing to dbt-based transformations, aligning
                    source-of-truth definitions, and ensuring downstream reports
                    remain stable as data and business logic evolve. This
                    foundation enabled more advanced use cases such as
                    forecasting systems, scenario planning, and decision support
                    models built on top of the same trusted data structures.

                    A recurring theme in my work is translating between
                    different stakeholder perspectives and levels of abstraction
                    — from operational teams needing fast, concrete signals, to
                    senior leadership requiring high-level clarity,
                    comparability, and confidence in the numbers. This has
                    shaped both how I design metrics and how I design
                    interfaces.

                    Beyond analytics logic, I’ve led cross-functional BI
                    redesign initiatives with Design and Marketing: migrating
                    legacy dashboards to a unified visual system, introducing
                    style guides, templates, and shared conventions (Figma /
                    Zeroheight), and raising data-visualization quality across
                    teams to ensure dashboards are not only correct, but usable.

                    I’ve been using GenAI and LLMs in production
                    analytics workflows since 2022, and actively explore emerging
                    patterns such as agentic systems, context management, and tool
                    orchestration. This includes connecting data, code, and analytical
                    tools via MCP-style interfaces and agentic IDEs, with the goal
                    of augmenting analytics teams and enabling stakeholders along
                    the decision chain to harness modern AI toolkits effectively.

## Offerings

I build the decision layer — 

                where data becomes action.

                    I specialize in building Power BI dashboards that translate complex data into
                        clear, trustworthy signals for decision-makers.

                    My focus is the last mile of analytics: the semantic model,
                    KPI logic, and visual interface where teams actually
                    interact with data and make decisions.

                    Behind the scenes, my background across analytics
                    engineering, modeling, and AI ensures that what looks simple
                    on the surface is technically sound, scalable, and
                    consistent underneath.

## PainPoints

Most companies have data. 

                Few have decision systems.

                    Most organizations invest heavily in data infrastructure and
                    dashboards — especially Power BI.

                    Yet despite all that effort, teams still argue about
                    numbers, export data to Excel, or ignore dashboards
                    altogether.

                    What’s missing isn’t data or tooling. It’s the decision
                    layer: clear metrics, shared logic, and interfaces designed
                    around how people actually make decisions.

                    This is where Power BI becomes powerful — not as a reporting
                    tool, but as a decision interface.
                    A place where logic, metrics, and design come together
                        to support real business decisions.

                    Static & Retrospective

                    Dashboards show what happened last month — but not why it
                    happened or what to do next.

                    Metrics are descriptive, not actionable, leaving teams stuck
                    reacting instead of deciding.

                    Untrusted Metrics

                    Different dashboards show different numbers for the same
                    KPI.

                    Without a shared semantic model, stakeholders lose trust —
                    and decision-making moves back to spreadsheets and meetings.

                    Ignored by the Business

                    Dashboards exist, but adoption is low.

                    Interfaces aren’t designed for real workflows, ownership is
                    unclear, and reports slowly drift out of relevance.

                The result: dashboards technically work — but decisions still
                happen elsewhere.

## Philosophy

Philosophy: Systems, Not Static
                    Structures

                        Companies behave less like fixed structures and more
                        like living systems. They react, fluctuate, and evolve.
                        Revenue moves in cycles, customers adapt, and markets
                        shift.

                        Beneath that motion, however, there is structure:
                        dynamics that can be modeled, abstracted, and
                        understood.

                        A dashboard metric, then, isn’t “just a number.” It’s
                        the visible surface of a deeper system. It's an
                        expression of the underlying data architecture, modeling
                        logic, and design choices, condensed into a single
                        signal.

                        I design and build abstractions that are technically
                        sound and aligned with how people actually make
                        decisions.

                        In practice, this means designing Power BI dashboards
                        that surface the right signal at the right moment — not
                        just more data.
